This project is concerned with documenting a set of java coding standards as used on projects by members of <a href='http://www.javacrafting.com'>javacrafting.com</a>. We will use the wiki to document our standards and the reasons behind having them.

Automation is key to successfully applying our coding standards to the projects we work on. We help clarify the decision behind having the coding standard using code examples whilst also showing how we can automate the detection.

All feedback is welcome and appreciated. We encourage others to question our standards and offer their own suggestions.
